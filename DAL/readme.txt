1. why are we using promises here?
    we use promises to control the flow of the functions and to show certain data first followed but whatever we put next on the stack.

2. what benefits are there for breaking out these functions into their own resource?
    makes the code easier to read and can debug easier as well.

3. what other functionality could you forsee leveraging this seperation of concerns technique with?
    you could use this on a user login page to delay loging in till the proper password is typed and correct to allow the connection. 
    you could use this for math problems, waiting for user input on a form.
